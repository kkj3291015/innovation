[How to do innovation right](https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/how-to-do-innovation-right)
1) Shoud innovation be outside-in or inside-out? 
- innovation mindset needs to be internalized within the DNA of the organization (specifically, how?)
- should be an essential culture of the organization culture (how?)
- empower each employee to question the status quo in order to explore improved options (how?) 

2) How measurable should the innovation agenda be? 
- resource being allocated to innovation need to result in tangible benefits and outcomes 
-- example 1: improved financial metric as determined by organisation 
-- example 2: non-finantial metric like customer experience and loyalty 
the metric should be "clearly spelt out" so that the innovation team can function with a clear direction and goals 

*Read "the Eight Essentials of Innovation, by Mckinsey and Co" 

3) Is Innovation only in technology?
- no. think about product, process and people 
- Amazon example of "360-deg innovation" 
-- creating a culture and environment in which each employee believes taht he/ she is a stakeholder in the success of the 
business and sees it as one's duty to improve the existing state
